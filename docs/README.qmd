Polars offers a good way to summarize a dataframe ``df`` via the ``df.describe`` method, however this returns the output in a wide (same number of columns as ``df``) format.  

```{python}
# | output: false
# | echo: false
import polars as pl
import sys
from pathlib import Path

cur_dir = Path.cwd()
src_dir = cur_dir.parent / "src" / "summtable"
sys.path.append("../src/summtable")
from utils import _sample_df

df = _sample_df()
```

```{python}
import polars as pl

# Polars
print(df.describe())
```

This package prints a summary table, mapping each input column to one row. 

```{python}
from summtable import show_summary

show_summary(df)
```

Primarily intended for polars data frame, works for pandas as well, however there is no guarantee that data-types are perfectly preserved.
